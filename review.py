# Write a program that uses a loop to print out:

#           2
#           4
#           6
#           8
# Who do we appreciate?

# Use a loop to complete this, either a for loop or a while loop.
# Each time through the loop, print out either 2, 4, 6 or 8.
# When the loop is finished, print "Who do we appreciate?"
# Remember how range can be used to create the list [2,4,6,8]
# When complete, commit to github and submit a pull request!

swag = [0, 2,4,6,8]
counter=1
while counter<len(swag):
    print swag[counter]
    counter = counter+1
print "Who do we appreciate?"
